## Hi people. Thanks to watching my Profile.

I’m a self-taught game developer using Unity and C#, currently building indie games in my free time.
I’ve created several small prototypes, including 2D puzzle games and physics-based platformers.
My strengths are game logic, character movement, and UI systems. I’m learning about shaders, optimization, and publishing to mobile and desktop platforms.

Game development is more than a hobby — it’s a way for me to tell stories and bring ideas to life through interactivity.
